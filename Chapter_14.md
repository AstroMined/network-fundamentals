## Introduction to Telecommunication Systems
- Deregulation allows for separate local and long-distance telephone systems, increasing competition and reducing costs.
- Point of presence (PoP) is where public telephone lines end and customer premises begin.
- Post-deregulation, residents and businesses are responsible for their side of the PoP.

## Remote Connection Technologies and Media
- Media types for long-distance communication include cable, DSL, ISDN, PSTN, satellite, SONET, and T1, with varying speeds and costs.
- BRI-ISDN: Two B channels, one D channel, total bandwidth 128 kbps.
- PRI-ISDN: Twenty-three B channels, one D channel, total data rate 1.544 Mbps.
- B-ISDN: Carries multiple frequencies, termed broadband.
- Cable Internet: Up to 36 Mbps downstream, 10 Mbps upstream (theoretical).
- DOCSIS standard defines Cable Internet service.
- DSL varieties: ADSL, SDSL, HDSL, VDSL.
- DSL distance limits and bandwidth vary by type and local central office proximity.
- Satellite communication: Ideal for remote locations, various speed options.
- Consumer satellite bandwidth typically 400-500 kbps; commercial up to 1.5 Mbps (US), 2 Mbps (Europe).
- Satellite communication requires a clear line of sight.
- T-carriers: Fractional T1 to T4, common in networking are T1, T2, T3.
- T1 line: 24 channels, 64 kbps each, maximum bandwidth 1.544 Mbps; T3 offers 44.736 Mbps.
- SONET: High bandwidth, long distances.
- X.25: Older telephone technology, more common outside the US.
- Frame Relay: Replaces X.25, uses a permanent virtual circuit (PVC).
- Frame Relay and X.25 are packet switching technologies.

## Dial-Up Networking
- Dial-up networking: Remote network access via telephone lines.
- Requires modems and remote access software on both client and server.
- SLIP: Older protocol for remote connections, replaced by PPP and PPTP.
- PPTP: Encapsulates protocols for secure connections.
- MPLS: Works with various networks (IPv4, IPv6, ATM, Frame Relay) for efficient routing.
- MPLS applications: Network traffic shaping and VPN support.

## Virtual Private Network (VPN)
- VPN: Secure connection over a public network based on software.
