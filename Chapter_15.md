## Hacking
- A hacker is a computer enthusiast experimenting with systems.
- Types of hackers: white-hat, black-hat, gray-hat.

## Common Network Security Breaches
- Authentication: verifying a userâ€™s identity.
- Encryption: encoding data using an algorithm.
- Unprotected network shares can be attack entry points.
- Social engineering uses personal skills to gain network access.
- Zeroconf for automatic network device detection.
- Denial of Service (DoS) attack overloads a server causing a crash.
- Man in the middle intercepts network transmissions.
- Spoofing uses a false IP address to gain access.
- Malware includes Trojan horses, viruses, worms, ransomware, logic bombs.
- DNS poisoning involves fake entries in DNS servers.
- Evil twin: a rogue wireless access point.
- Deauthentication/deassociation attacks disconnect clients from reliable sources.
- Phishing emails mimic legitimate enterprises to gather personal information.
- Insider threats pose a critical security risk.

## Intrusion Detection and Intrusion Prevention Systems
- IDS and IPS monitor for unauthorized activity.

## Security Methods and Protocols
- Key encryption methods: symmetric-key and asymmetric-key.
- Digital certificates verify identities.
- Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) secure internet transactions.
- Virtual Network Connection (VNC) for remote access.
- IPSec secures IP packets on unsecured networks.
- Secure Shell (SSH) provides secure network services.
- Secure Copy Protocol (SCP) securely transfers files.

## Wireless Security
- Wireless networks use SSIDs for identification.
- MAC filters control WAP access.
- Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA/WPA2), IEEE 802.11i for wireless network security.
- 802.1x provides network access control.

## Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)
- AAA protocols include RADIUS, Diameter, and TACACS+.
- Authentication types: something known, something had, something you are, somewhere you are, something you do.
- Strong authentication requires mechanisms from at least two categories.

## Authentication Protocols
- PAP, CHAP, MS-CHAP, Kerberos, EAP, PEAP, LEAP for authentication.
- Kerberos uses two keys similar to public and private keys.

## Security Implementations
- Apply software patches and service packs immediately after system installation.
- Change default administrator usernames.
- Device hardening: securing devices as much as possible.
- Strong passwords use letters, numbers, special symbols.
- Password policies: history, length, age, complexity.
- Firewalls monitor and control data packets.
- Unified threat management (UTM) combines security technologies.
- Proxy servers hide clients from unauthorized external access.

## Security Tools
- Netstat utility: checks open ports.
- Protocol analyzers and packet sniffers monitor network protocols and data packets.
- Policies for security measures, remote access guidelines, BYOD rules, equipment disposal, data loss prevention, incident response.

## Data Security Compliance Requirements
- Standards are voluntary, laws are legally binding.
