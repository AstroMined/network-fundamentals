## Unix
- Unix was developed at the AT&T Bell Laboratories in the 1960s.
- The source code used for components is readily available to anyone.
- Unix/Linux consists of the system kernel surrounded by modules.
- A daemon is a program that runs in the background and waits for a client to request its services.

## Linux
- Linux is a variation of the Unix operating system.
- The term 'Linux' refers to the operating system kernel.
- The Linux kernel was created in 1991 at the University of Helsinki by Linus Torvalds.
- Linux uses a General Public License (GPL), known as a copyleft, to allow Linux users to copy, modify, and distribute Linux software.
- The Linux kernel is further enhanced by many software packages, such as GNOME, KDE, Apache, and Samba, which have become the de facto standard for distribution with Linux.
- Advantages to Linux include flexibility and price. Disadvantages include a lack of support and vulnerability to hacking or cracking.

## Unix/Linux Basics
- LILO and GRUB are boot loader programs that start the Linux operating system load process and can be used to load other operating systems.
- A shell is a user interface that interprets and carries out commands.
- Unix/Linux file and directory names are case-sensitive.
- Several choices of Linux file systems are available, such as Ext2, Ext3, Ext4, ReiserFS, JFS1, and JFS.
- ReiserFS, JFS, JFS1, Ext3, and Ext4 are journaling file systems.
- A journaling file system ensures file integrity by maintaining a log of all file activity whenever an unexpected system shutdown occurs.
- The Unix/Linux file structure looks similar to the Microsoft file structure; however, Unix/Linux does not use drive letters.
- The top of the Unix/Linux directory structure is called the root directory and is indicated by the forward slash (/) symbol.
- All file structures from storage devices, such as CD-ROM drives and shared resources from remote systems, are appended to the root through the mounting process.
- Hardware such as the DVD device must be mounted before it can be used.
- The read, write, and execute permission can be set for a file or directoryâ€™s owner, default group, and other users.
- The highest level of administration is the superuser and has the default user account name of root.
- The Network File System (NFS) was developed by Sun Microsystems for exchanging files on a network.
- NFS works in conjunction with TCP/IP to transfer files across a network system.
- Local and remote printing services are handled by the line printer daemon (lpd).
- Various protocols and services, such as FTP, TFTP, Telnet, and Apache, provide remote access to clients anywhere in the world.
- Apache is the default Web server software package used with Unix/Linux.

## X Windows System
- The X Windows system provides a GUI for Unix and Linux systems.
- The X Windows system consists of an X server and an X client and has a client/server architecture.
- When X server is installed, it is configured for the system hardware.
- Two of the most commonly used desktop environments used with Unix/Linux are GNOME and KDE.
- A tarball is a compressed file containing one or more software programs.

## Interoperability
- Samba is a free software package that allows Unix/Linux systems to share files and printers with Windows-based clients.
- Originally, Microsoft used gateway services to support interoperability between Unix/Linux systems.
- Windows Server 2016 provides support for NFS through the Services for Network File System server role.

## Mac OS X Server
- Mac OS X Server is designed from open-source software and contains all the features found in a typical Linux system, such as Samba, Apache, X Windows, CUPS, and LDAP.
- Workstations running Mac OS X, Windows, or Unix/Linux can be connected.
