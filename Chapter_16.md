## Monitoring the Server and Network
- Constant monitoring is essential to identify failures or predict possible issues.
- Documentation and diagrams are crucial for network maintenance.
- Establish a baseline and routinely collect data for event prediction.
- Compare current network performance indicators with the baseline to identify trends.

## Maintaining System Software
- Software bugs are programming flaws.
- Patches or fixes correct bugs and security issues.
- Microsoft releases fixes and patches as service packs.
- Test software patches, fixes, and service packs before network-wide application.

## Maintaining System Hardware
- Server clusters allow maintenance without disrupting network activities.
- Adding switches to create VLANs can enhance network bandwidth.

## Maintaining System Integrity
- Data integrity: Completeness and accuracy of network-stored data.
- Disaster recovery: Restoring normal operations after a disaster.
- Regular data backups and ongoing data protection are vital.
- Backup types: Full (complete copy, resets archive bit), incremental (copies changes since last incremental backup, resets archive bit), differential (copies changes since last full backup, does not reset archive bit).

## Maintaining Stable Electrical Power
- Lightning arrestors dampen electrical surges from lightning.
- Inductive reactance occurs in coiled wire within various electrical devices.
- Brownouts: Partial loss of power; Blackouts: Total power loss.
- UPS types: Standby and continuous.
- Isolation transformers isolate circuits from other circuits from the same electrical source.
