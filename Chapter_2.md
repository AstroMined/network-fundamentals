# Chapter 2: Summary Network Media

The three major classifications of network media are copper cable, fiber-optic cable, and wireless radio waves.

### Analog and Digital Signals
- Electronic signals are classified as analog and digital. 
- Analog and digital signals differ by the shape of their waveforms.
- Both analog and digital waves have a frequency measurement.
- Bandwidth is a measurement of the ability of network media to carry data.

### Data Transmission
- Baseband is a method of transmitting a single frequency using the entire bandwidth of a cable.
- Broadband is a method of transmitting multiple frequencies or data across a cable at once.
- Communication can occur in one of three modes: simplex, half-duplex, and full-duplex.

### Electronic Terms
- Direct current (DC) travels in one direction.
- Alternating current (AC) constantly reverses its direction of flow.
- Electrical resistance opposes the flow of electrical energy.
- Impedance is the opposition to the flow of AC.
- Reflected loss is the amount of signal reflected from the end of a cable.
- Crosstalk is the induction of current in a cable from a nearby conductor.

### Copper-Core Cables
- Copper conductor wire size is based on its diameter.
- Common coaxial cable types include RG-6, RG-8, and RG-58.
- Twisted-pair cable is divided into seven categories.

### IEEE 802 Standard
- The IEEE 802.3 standard describes Ethernet technologies.
- Auto-MDIX compliant devices automatically reassign pin functions.
- Power over Ethernet (PoE) powers devices over network cable.

### Wiring Faults
- Wiring faults include shorts, opens, reversed pairs, crossed pairs, and split pairs.
