## Characteristics of Fiber-Optic Cable
- Fiber-optic cable consists of a glass or plastic core that carries pulses of light that represent binary data.
- Advantages of fiber-optic cable:
    - Provides for data security
    - Immune to electromagnetic interference
    - Lightweight and small in diameter
    - Safe from fire and explosion
    - Wide bandwidth
    - Corrosion-and water-resistant
    - Supports data transmission over longer distances than copper-core cable.

## Nature of Light
- Light is described in wavelengths.
- A wavelength is the total distance the electromagnetic wave or light wave travels during one full cycle.
- Wavelengths are measured in nanometers (nm) or one billionth of a meter.

## Fiber-Optic Cable Construction
- Fiber-optic cable cores are composed of either glass or plastic.
- The core is surrounded by cladding which restricts the light to the core area.
- Scattering is the loss of light due to impurities in the core material.
- Dispersion is the distortion of light waves caused by the light reflecting from the cladding material and arriving at different times at the far end of the cable.
- Extrinsic losses are caused by physical factors not normally found in the core material such as at splices and connector locations.

## Fiber-Optic Cable Specifications
- Two broad classifications of fiber-optic cable based on its ability to carry light are multimode and single-mode.
    - Single-mode fiber-optic cable has a smaller core diameter than multimode fiber-optic cable and carries light farther and with less attenuation.
    - Two classifications of multimode fiber-optic cable are graded-index and step-index.
    - Graded-index multimode fiber-optic cable is designed with a varying grade of core material that allows for maximum light conduction at the center of the core. Step-index multimode fiber-optic cable does not have a special core design and is therefore greatly affected by dispersion.

## IEEE 802.3 Standards
- The 802.3z standard describes the 1000BaseSX, 1000BaseLX, and 1000BaseCX Gigabit Ethernet classifications.
- The 802.3ae 10 Gigabit Ethernet standard describes the 10GBaseSR, 10GBaseLR, 10GBaseEW, and 10GBaseER classifications.
- 10GBaseW is a collection of cable standards such as 10GBaseSW, 10GBaseLW, and 10GBaseEW.

## Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI)
- FDDI is used mainly as a backbone for large network systems such as a MAN or a WAN.
- FDDI is structured as a pair of rings.

## Fiber-Optic Cable Connectors
- Connector styles include SC, ST, FC, LC, and MTRJ.

## Fiber-Optic Cable Installation and Troubleshooting
- Fiber-optic cabling is cleaved, not cut.
- A splice that is joined by heat is called a fusion splice.
- A light source and fiber-optic light meter is used to test short runs of fiber-optic cable by comparing the amount of light injected in one end of the cable to the light power at the other end of the cable.
- The OTDR is used to measure the effects of scattering and cabling faults in long fiber-optic cable runs. It can also measure the distance to a cable fault or break.
