## Electromagnetic Waves
- Radio-wave and microwave transmissions work on the principle of producing a carrier wave as the means of communication between two network devices.
- Modulation is the mixing of two radio signals, typically a carrier wave with a data signal.
- Infrared is used in line-of-sight transmissions and is not susceptible to radio interference.
- The FCC regulates the use of the electromagnetic spectrum by assigning radio frequencies and maximum power ratings to devices.
- A common source of interference for wireless networks is industrial, scientific, and medical devices that use frequencies in the same range as wireless networks.
- Infrared is commonly used for point-to-point transmission between two devices such as a personal digital assistant and a PC.

## Antenna Styles
- Two main classifications of antennas based on the shape of the electromagnetic wave pattern they produce are omni-directional and directional.
- Antennas are further categorized by their styles, which can be omni, dipole, flat panel, Yagi, or parabolic dish.

## Radio-Wave Transmission Techniques
- Radio waves are electromagnetic waves that cover the 10 kHz to 300,000 MHz frequency range.
- Transmission techniques for radio-wave-based network devices include single frequency, spread spectrum, and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM).
- Spread spectrum subdivides the allocated frequency range into smaller units called channels. Types include frequency hopping and direct sequencing.
- Frequency hopping avoids interference by changing channels while transmitting data.
- Direct sequencing consists of 11 overlapping channels of 83 MHz each in a 2.4-GHz spectrum. Three channels do not overlap and can be used simultaneously.

## Radio-Wave-Based Networking
- A wireless access point (WAP) connects a wireless network to a cable-based network and serves as the communication center in a wireless network.
- A service set identifier (SSID) is similar to a workgroup or domain name and must be assigned to a WAP.
- Wireless networks with one or more WAPs operate in infrastructure mode.
- Wireless networks without a WAP operate in ad hoc mode.
- IEEE 802.11 standards describe different wireless network specifications:
    - 802.11a: 5 GHz, maximum 54 Mbps
    - 802.11b: 2.4 GHz, maximum 11 Mbps
    - 802.11g: 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz, maximum 54 Mbps
    - 802.11n: 5 GHz and 2.4 GHz, maximum 300 to 600 Mbps
- Multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) and spatial multiplexing are used in the IEEE 802.11n standard to increase throughput and range.
- IEEE 802.15 describes wireless personal area networks (WPANs).
- Wireless networks under IEEE 802.11 use carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA).
- Bluetooth, recognized by the 802.11 standard, is used for short-range data transfer in the 2.4-GHz band.

## Microwave Transmission and Networking
- Satellite communication experiences propagation delay due to the great distance a signal must travel.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Wireless Technology
- Wireless technology can be cost-effective compared to cable-based networks.
- Disadvantages include vulnerability to atmospheric conditions and security concerns.
