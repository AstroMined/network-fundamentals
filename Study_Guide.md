#### **Definition of a Network**
Welcome to the fascinating world of networking! Let's start with what a network is. Imagine a web connecting various computers, devices, and communication tools. These connections allow them to share resources and data. This interconnected system is what we call a network. It consists of nodes and hosts. The major benefit of networking is that it lets us share equipment and data effortlessly. However, there's a downside: networks can be costly and vulnerable to cyberattacks.

#### **Network Classifications**
Networks come in different sizes and serve various purposes. Here are the main types:
- **Local Area Network (LAN)**: This is like your home network, covering a small area.
- **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)**: Think of a city's public Wi-Fi system.
- **Wide Area Network (WAN)**: This spans across cities, countries, or even continents, like the internet.
Other types include:
- **Personal Area Network (PAN)**: Your personal Bluetooth devices.
- **Campus Area Network (CAN)**: Networks within a university or business campus.
- **Global Area Network (GAN)**: Global networks that connect multiple wide area networks.

#### **Network Topologies**
The structure or layout of a network is called its topology. Here are four common ones:
- **Star Topology**: All devices connect to a central hub.
- **Ring Topology**: Devices form a circular chain.
- **Bus Topology**: All devices share a single communication line.
- **Mesh Topology**: Devices are interconnected, providing multiple pathways.
Sometimes, networks combine these topologies, forming hybrid topologies.

#### **Basic Network Administration Models**
Networks can be managed in different ways:
- **Centralized Administration**: Used in client/server networks where a central server controls everything.
- **Decentralized Administration**: Used in peer-to-peer networks where each device manages itself.

#### **Cloud Computing**
Cloud computing offers various services:
- **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: Like using Google Docs online.
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: For developers to build applications.
- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: Renting virtual machines and storage.
Clouds can be:
- **Private**: For a single organization.
- **Public**: Available to anyone.
- **Hybrid**: A mix of both.
Software-defined networking (SDN) is a key cloud feature that allows for flexible network management.

#### **Network Operating System (NOS)**
A Network Operating System (NOS) helps nodes communicate. Examples include Windows Server, Unix, and Linux.

#### **Network Communication**
Data transmitted over a network is divided into segments. A typical packet includes a data segment, source and destination addresses, error checking, and sequence identification.

#### **Protocols**
Protocols are sets of rules for communication between nodes. For two computers to communicate, they must use the same protocol. One example is the Link-Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP), which exchanges information between devices on the same local area network.

#### **Network Addresses**
Each node in a network has a unique identifier called a network address. There are two main types:
- **MAC Address**: A physical address unique to each network interface card.
- **IP Address**: A logical address assigned based on the network.

#### **Network Media and Devices**
Several devices and media are essential in a network:

  - Yellow Triangle: Problem exists.

#### **Troubleshooting Common Network Problems**
Common issues often stem from human errors or misconfigurations:

- **Typical Issues**
  - Login problems, connection issues, share access, network printing, malware, IP address conflicts, application server access, VoIP issues, duplex mismatch, Internet access problems.

#### **Troubleshooting Common Wireless Problems**
Wireless networks can experience unique issues:

- **Wireless Issues**
  - Incorrect ESSID, signal bounce, mismatched encryption, unbalanced signal-to-noise ratio.

#### **Troubleshooting with TCP/IP Utilities**
TCP/IP utilities help diagnose network paths and issues:

- **Ping and Tracert**
  - Verify network path and identify breaks.

- **Pathping**
  - Combines Ping and Tracert to identify bottlenecks by sending ICMP echo requests.

#### **Miscellaneous Issues**
Additional network problems can include:

- **Incorrect Time Settings**
  - Ensure time synchronization across network devices.

- **ACL (Access Control List) Configurations**
  - Verify ACL settings to ensure proper access permissions.

### Lesson: Network Needs Assessment and Design

---

#### **Needs Assessment and Design**
The foundation of a successful network design begins with a thorough needs assessment:

- **Conducting a Needs Assessment**
  - Evaluate the current and future needs of the organization.
  - Consider the physical network structure, security requirements, applications, organizational structure, fault tolerance, and data integrity.

- **Organizational Structure Considerations**
  - Determine the number of servers required.
  - Design the directory structure and resource locations.
  - Plan partition and volume configurations.

- **LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)**
  - Standard protocol for directory services, facilitating the organization of network resources.

- **Naming Conventions**
  - Develop a consistent and logical naming convention for network objects to simplify management and troubleshooting.

#### **Network Design Tools**
Various tools and case studies assist in planning and visualizing network designs:

- **Microsoft Assessment and Planning (MAP) Toolkit**
  - Helps in system updates or migration by assessing the current network environment.

- **Microsoft Visio**
  - A diagramming tool for creating detailed network maps and structures.

- **NetworkView**
  - Creates comprehensive network maps, highlighting device locations and connections.

#### **Installation Process**
A structured installation process ensures a smooth network deployment:

- **Timeline Development**
  - Plan the installation process with a detailed timeline.

- **Automation Tools**
  - Utilize Microsoft tools to automate software and operating system installations.

- **Testing**
  - Test all sections of the network post-implementation to ensure functionality.

- **Documentation and Training**
  - Develop comprehensive network documents, including security procedures and usage rules.
  - Train users on security policies, remote access, and email fundamentals.

#### **Specifications for Network Design**
Clear specifications guide the quality and materials used in the network design:

- **Workmanship and Materials**
  - Specify standards for workmanship and materials to ensure network reliability.

- **Isolated Electrical Systems**
  - Use isolated electrical systems for network equipment to prevent interference.

- **Demarcation Point**
  - Defines where public/private telecom cables end, and customer cabling begins.

- **MDF and IDF**
  - **MDF (Main Distribution Frame)**: Central point for incoming telecom cables.
  - **IDF (Intermediate Distribution Frame)**: Secondary distribution point for telecom cables.

- **Cabling Limits**
  - **Horizontal Cable Distance**: Limited to 90 meters.
  - **Backbone Wiring Limits**:
    - UTP: 90 meters.
    - Multimode Fiber-Optic: 2000 meters.
    - Single-Mode Fiber-Optic: 3000 meters.

- **Punch Down Blocks**
  - Used for distributing and connecting telecommunication cables.

#### **Standards Organizations**
Adhering to standards ensures network compatibility and quality:

- **ANSI/TIA/EIA**
  - Primary network design standards in the U.S.

- **ISO**
  - International standards organization for network design.

- **CSA**
  - Canadian equivalent to ANSI/TIA/EIA standards.

- **Wiring Standards**
  - Consolidation points and MUTOAs (Multi-User Telecommunications Outlet Assemblies) in horizontal wiring.
  - Maximum patch panel cable length in telecom rooms: 7 meters.

- **National Electrical Code (NEC)**
  - Standards for electrical work in network installations.

- **BICSI**
  - Nonprofit organization providing telecommunication installation and training standards.
