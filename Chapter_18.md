## Needs Assessment and Design
- Conducting a needs assessment is the first step in network design.
- Considerations: physical network structure, security, applications, organizational structure, fault tolerance, data integrity.
- Organizational structure questions determine server number, directory structure, resource location, partition, and volume configuration.
- LDAP is the standard directory protocol.
- Develop a naming convention for network objects.

## Network Design Tools
- Various utilities and case studies assist in network design.
- Microsoft Assessment and Planning (MAP) toolkit aids in system updates or migration.
- Microsoft Visio for diagramming network systems and structures.
- NetworkView creates network maps.

## Installation Process
- Develop a timeline for the installation process.
- Microsoft tools automate software and operating system installations.
- Test all network sections post-implementation.
- Develop network documents with security procedures and usage rules.
- Train users in security policies, remote access, email fundamentals, etc.

## Specifications for Network Design
- Specifications outline workmanship and materials for the project.
- Use isolated electrical systems for network equipment.
- Demarcation point: where public/private telecom cables end and customer cabling begins.
- MDF: Connection point for incoming private telecom cables.
- MDF and IDF: Relative locations for telecom cable distribution.
- Horizontal cable distance limited to 90 meters.
- Backbone wiring limits: UTP (90 meters), multimode fiber-optic (2000 meters), single-mode fiber-optic (3000 meters).
- Punch down blocks distribute and connect telecommunication cables.

## Standards Organizations
- ANSI/TIA/EIA: Main network design standard in the U.S.
- ISO: European standards organization.
- CSA: Canadian equivalent to ANSI/TIA/EIA.
- Consolidation points and MUTOAs in horizontal wiring.
- Maximum patch panel cable length in telecommunication rooms: 7 meters.
- National Electrical Code (NEC) standards for electrical work.
- BICSI: Nonprofit organization for telecommunication installation and training.
