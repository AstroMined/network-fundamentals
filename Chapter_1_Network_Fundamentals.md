# Chapter 1: Definition of a Network

## Definition of a Network
- Networks are interconnected collections of computers, computer-related equipment, and communication devices.
- Networks consist of nodes and hosts.
- Advantages of networking include providing a way to share equipment and data.
- Disadvantages of networks include increased personnel and costs, as well as vulnerabilities to cyberattacks.

## Network Classifications
- The three classifications of networks based on size, management, and use of private or public communication systems are:
  - Local Area Network (LAN)
  - Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
  - Wide Area Network (WAN)
- Additional categories of networks include:
  - Personal Area Network (PAN)
  - Campus Area Network (CAN)
  - Global Area Network (GAN)

## Network Topologies
- The four common network topologies are:
  - Star
  - Ring
  - Bus
  - Mesh
- Hybrid topologies exist which blend more than one traditional topology.

## Basic Network Administration Models
- Centralized administration is used to administer a client/server network.
- Decentralized administration is used to administer a peer-to-peer network.

## Cloud Computing
- Cloud computing offers services to users including:
  - Software as a Service (SaaS)
  - Platform as a Service (PaaS)
  - Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Clouds can be private, public, or hybrid.
- Software-defined networking (SDN) is available through cloud computing.

## Network Operating System (NOS)
- A Network Operating System provides a communication system between nodes.
- Examples include Windows Server 2008/2012/2016, Unix, and Linux.

## Network Communication
- Data to be transmitted on a network is divided into segments.
- A typical packet contains a data segment, source and destination address, error checking, and sequence identification.

## Protocols
- A protocol is a set of rules that controls communication between two nodes.
- Two computers need to use the same protocol to communicate with each other.
- Link-Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) exchanges information between network devices in the same local area network.

## Network Addresses
- A network address is a unique identifier for a node on a network.
- Two types of addresses are used: MAC addresses (physical addresses) and IP addresses (logical addresses).

## Network Media and Devices
- Media converters convert one type of electrical signal into another.
- Repeaters regenerate digital signals, extending network media beyond its recommended length.
- A hub provides a central connection point for a network.
- A gateway device connects the local area network and the Internet.
- A bridge segments a larger network to reduce the chance of collisions.
- A switch serves as a central connection point and provides network segmentation.
- A router connects various networks together, providing alternate routes for data packets.

## Standards and Organizations
- Organizations that develop standards for network media include:
  - Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE)
  - International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
  - World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
  - Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA)
  - American National Standards Institute (ANSI)

## OSI Model
- The OSI model serves as a guide for troubleshooting and designing networks.
- It is based on a model first developed by the Department of Defense.
- The OSI model consists of seven layers: physical, data link, network, transport, session, presentation, and application.
- The data link layer is divided into two sublayers: logical link control (LLC) and media access control (MAC).
