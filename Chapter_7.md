## Unix
- Developed at AT&T Bell Laboratories in the 1960s.
- Source code for components is readily available.
- Unix/Linux consists of the system kernel surrounded by modules.
- A daemon is a background program awaiting client service requests.

## Linux
- A variation of the Unix operating system.
- The term "Linux" refers to the operating system kernel.
- Created in 1991 at the University of Helsinki by Linus Torvalds.
- Uses a General Public License (GPL) for free copying, modifying, and distributing of Linux software.
- Enhanced by software packages like GNOME, KDE, Apache, and Samba, standard in Linux distributions.
- Advantages: flexibility and price. Disadvantages: lack of support and vulnerability to hacking.

## Unix/Linux Basics
- LILO and GRUB are boot loader programs that start the Linux operating system.
- A shell interprets and carries out commands.
- Unix/Linux file and directory names are case-sensitive.
- File system options include Ext2, Ext3, Ext4, ReiserFS, JFS1, and JFS.
- Journaling file systems (ReiserFS, JFS, JFS1, Ext3, Ext4) maintain a log for file integrity during unexpected shutdowns.
- Unix/Linux file structure does not use drive letters.
- The root directory is at the top of the Unix/Linux structure, indicated by "/".
- File structures from devices like CD-ROM drives are appended to the root via mounting.
- Hardware like DVD devices must be mounted before use.
- File and directory permissions can be set for the owner, default group, and other users.
- The superuser (root) has the highest level of administration.
- Network File System (NFS) by Sun Microsystems is for file exchange on a network.
- NFS works with TCP/IP for network file transfers.
- Local and remote printing services via the line printer daemon (lpd).
- Protocols and services like FTP, TFTP, Telnet, and Apache allow remote access.
- Apache is the default web server software for Unix/Linux.

## X Windows System
- Provides a GUI for Unix and Linux systems.
- Consists of an X server and an X client with a client/server architecture.
- Configured for system hardware upon installation.
- Common desktop environments include GNOME and KDE.
- A tarball is a compressed file with one or more software programs.

## Interoperability
- Samba enables file and printer sharing between Unix/Linux and Windows clients.
- Microsoft used gateway services for Unix/Linux interoperability.
- Windows Server 2016 supports NFS through the Services for Network File System server role.

## Mac OS X Server
- Designed from open-source software, similar to a typical Linux system.
- Includes features like Samba, Apache, X Windows, CUPS, and LDAP.
- Compatible with Mac OS X, Windows, and Unix/Linux workstations.
