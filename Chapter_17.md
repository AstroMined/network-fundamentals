## CompTIA Network+ Troubleshooting Methodology
- Seven steps to troubleshooting a network: Identify the problem, establish a probable cause theory, test the theory, establish a resolution plan, implement the solution, verify system functionality, document findings and actions.
- Asking questions helps diagnose problems.
- Investigate recent changes that could have caused the problem.

## Stages of Computer Operation
- Three areas to consider during computer troubleshooting: POST, operating system loading, after successful logon.
- Common failures: hardware (POST), OS file or driver corruption (pre-logon), application software or service (post-logon).
- System Configuration (msconfig.exe) helps identify problematic applications or services.

## Detailed Computer Startup Process
- Startup phases: POST, initial startup, Windows Boot Loader, Kernel loading, logon phase.
- Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) is a BIOS system alternative.
- Windows Boot Manager selects operating systems in multi-OS setups.
- Access Advanced Boot Options menu using [F8] after POST.

## Windows-Based Troubleshooting Tools
- Safe Mode: Boots with limited drivers and memory.
- System Restore: Reverts to previous registry settings.
- Last Known Good Configuration: Loads OS with last successful registry data.

## System Recovery Strategies and Methods
- Disk image: Exact sector-by-sector copy of the OS and files.
- Windows 7 System Recovery Options: Startup Repair, System Restore, System Image Recovery, Windows Memory Diagnostic, Command Prompt.
- Windows 10 System Recovery Options: Restore from a point, System Restore, System Reset, Reinstall Windows, Command Prompt.

## Troubleshooting Dual-Boot Systems
- System Configuration tool (msconfig.exe) selects startup programs and services.
- Boot.ini file in Windows XP replaced with Boot Configuration Data (BCD) in later versions.

## Server Data Integrity and Performance
- Ensure server data integrity and performance with UPS units, RAID systems, frequent backups, malware protection, service packs, and patches.

## Troubleshooting the Network Infrastructure
- Network Diagnostics utility: Diagnoses common network issues.
- Network and Sharing Center: Centralized network configuration and troubleshooting.
- Network status indicators: Red X (no connection), yellow triangle (problem).

## Troubleshooting Common Network Problems
- Common network errors often result from human interaction.
- Typical issues: Login problems, connection issues, share access, network printing, malware, IP address issues, application server access, VoIP issues, duplex mismatch, Internet access problems.

## Troubleshooting Common Wireless Problems
- Wireless issues: Incorrect ESSID, signal bounce, mismatched encryption, unbalanced signal-to-noise ratio.

## Troubleshooting with TCP/IP Utilities
- Ping and tracert: Verify network path.
- Pathping: Identifies bottlenecks by sending ICMP echo requests.

## Miscellaneous Issues
- Other network problems include incorrect time settings and ACL configurations.
