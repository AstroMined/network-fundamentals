## Voice and Audio Signals
- An analog signal is converted to digital by sampling the amplitude at specific times.
- Sampling rate: number of times a signal is sampled in a period.
- Sampling frequency: number of times a signal is sampled per second.
- Jitter: small delays in audio/video delivery, caused by latency or missing packets.
- Latency: delay of data en route to its destination.
- Acceptable latency delay is approximately 250 milliseconds.
- Acoustical echo: feedback caused by close proximity of microphone and speaker or improper audio adjustment.

## Video
- Video images typically occur at a minimum rate of 24 frames per second.
- Codec: software, hardware, or both that compresses and decompresses video and audio.

## Other Transmission Protocols
- X.25: early protocol for data transfer over telephone lines.
- Frame Relay: packet switching protocol using leased lines for long-distance data transport.
- Asynchronous transfer mode (ATM): designed for audio, video, and multimedia, with five classifications (CBR, VBR-nrt, VBR-rt, ABR, UBR).
- ATM cell maximum size: 53 bytes (5-byte header, 48-byte payload).
- Voice over IP (VoIP): uses TCP/IP to carry audio and video data.
- VoIP uses UDP for time-sensitive data (e.g., phone conversation) and TCP for audio/video streaming.
- Bandwidth shaper: prioritizes network packets for quality service in time-sensitive applications.
- H.323 protocol: used in telecommunication and telephone equipment.
- Gateway converts TCP/IP protocol to H.323.
- Session Initiation Protocol (SIP): used for initiating, maintaining, and terminating data exchange.
- Quality of Service (QoS): developed to minimize latency.
- Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP): streams voice and video in video conferencing and gaming.

## Basic VoIP Troubleshooting
- Protocol analyzers identify VoIP-related problems.
- Impedance mismatch refers to the effect of connecting two electronic audio systems with different characteristics.
