## The Evolution of Network Protocols
- In the early days, the Internet had limited access, primarily used by the Department of Defense (DoD) and certain universities.
- Various companies developed proprietary networking methods.
- These early protocols were not designed for the public Internet usage.

## Common Network Operating System Traits
- Common features of a network operating system include shared resources, file storage, file management, security, troubleshooting utilities, services, and a user interface.
- A graphical user interface (GUI) allows user access to resources and programs via a mouse click.
- Command-line environments involve typing commands at a text-based interface, the command prompt.

## Network Operating Systems and Hardware Protocols
- The data link layer places data on the network media or receives data and passes it up the OSI layers.
- Defined by IEEE 802.2 standard.
- Ethernet uses CSMA/CA for network media access.
- A broadcast storm is continuous activity on an Ethernet network.
- CSMA/CA attempts to avoid collisions by detecting communication on the network media.
- A collision domain is where collisions occur in an Ethernet network.
- Segmenting an Ethernet network can reduce collisions.

## Network Operating Systems and Networking Protocols
- TCP/IP is a suite of protocols designed for Internet communication.
- The Link-Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) identifies devices on a local area network.
- Microsoftâ€™s Link-Layer Topology Discovery Mapper I/O Driver and Responder are based on LLDP.
- Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) is based on LLDP.
- LLDP-Media Endpoint Discovery (LLDP-MED) is used for switches, VoIP devices, and PoE devices.
- Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) functions like a DNS server when one is unavailable.
- Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is one of the oldest networking protocols.
